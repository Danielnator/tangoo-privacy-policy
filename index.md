# Privacy Policy

*Effective Date: 25th November 2024*

## Introduction

Welcome to Tangoo ("we," "us," or "our"). Tangoo is a Japanese dictionary mobile application designed to help users learn Japanese through a dictionary, word lists, grammars and customizable tests. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information Collection and Use

Tangoo is an entirely offline application. We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data to our servers or third-party services. All data related to your usage of the app is stored locally on your device.

## Data Stored Locally

- **Dictionary**: The entire Japanese dictionary data is saved locally in a Database on your device.
- **Word Lists**: You can create custom word lists and assign words to them. This data is saved locally on your device.
- **Grammar Favorites**: You have the option to mark grammar items as favorites. These preferences are stored on your device.
- **Test Data**: Any test settings, progress or performance data from spaced repetition tests is stored locally to enhance your learning experience.

## Third-Party Services

Tangoo does not integrate with any third-party services, libraries, or SDKs that collect or analyze user data. There are no analytics tools, advertising networks, or social media integrations within the app.

## Security

Since all your data is stored locally and we do not collect any personal information, we do not implement specific security measures related to data transmission or storage. However, we recommend securing your device with a password or biometric lock to protect your data.

## Children's Privacy

Tangoo is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at *daniel.tangooapp@gmail.com* so we can address the issue promptly.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since Tangoo is still in active development, future features might significantly impact what data we store and process. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
